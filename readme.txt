Gust is a port of Ghost admin panel for WordPress.

== Description ==

At the begining, Ghost was supposed to be a fork of WordPress. Then there was a talk of a plugin, that would give a next-generation admin panel for WordPress. But in the process it became a new blogging platform, built on Node.js. This plugin is an attempt to bring the nice and clean admin panel of Ghost back to the WordPress ecosystem. 

Current features:

*   Posts/Pages Markdown editor
*   Media upload integration
*   Post tags support
*   **NEW** Post category support
*   **NEW** Post scheduling support

Requirements:

*   PHP **5.3** or greater

== Installation ==

1. Upload `gust` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Make sure pretty permalinks are enabled
1. Go to yourdomain.com/gust

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why I cannot add/remove categories = 

Category manager is comming in v0.4

= Why do you require PHP 5.3? =

One of the libraries Gust uses, Flight, requires it.

= Are you affiliated with Ghost =

No, I am not. This is an unofficial port, hence the different name.

= Where is the X feature =

This is an early release, so some features, like category/featured images support, are not present, yet. They will be, later on, if the plugin gets enough interest.
